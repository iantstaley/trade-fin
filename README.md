# trade-fin
POC for trade finance using Corda DLT
International Trade finance is a multi-party interaction and it is pretty complex and governed by international law.
What I will start with a  simplified view of the problem and start adding more flows and complexity as we go along.

To start with we will try to implement the below major workflow.

1. SALE AGREEMENT -  Buyer, Seller.
2. Letter Of Credit - Buyer, Seller, IssuingBank,AdvisingBank.
3. Phyto Certification - Seller, USDA and Carrier.
4. Bill of Lading  -  Buyer, Seller, IssuingBank,AdvisingBank.

Please refer WorkFlow.pdf for more details on the problem domain.
